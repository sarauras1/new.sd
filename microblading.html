<p style="margin-top: 30px;">
  Microblading is a tattooing technique in which a small hand-held tool made of several tiny needles is used to add 
  semi-permanent pigment to the skin. Microblading differs from standard eyebrow tattooing because each hair stroke is
   created by hand using a blade which creates fine hair strokes in the skin, whereas eyebrow tattoos are done with a
    machine and single needle. Microblading is typically used on eyebrows to create, enhance or reshape their appearance
     in terms of both shape and colour. It deposits pigment into the upper region of the dermis so it fades more rapidly 
     than traditional tattooing techniques which deposit pigment deeper. Microblading artists are not necessarily tattoo
      artists, and vice versa, because the techniques require different training.
  </p>

  <h4 class="text-center"><strong>Price: £ £550</strong></h4>

<h3>Durability</h3>
<p>The microblading procedure is a semi-permanent tattoo. Like all tattoos, microblading can fade, depending 
  on multiple factors, including quality of pigment/ink used, UV exposure, elements found in skincare products
   and medications. The treatment lasts from one to two years.
  A touch-up session is encouraged 6 months after the first microblading procedure.</p>

<h3>Aftercare</h3>

<p>Please read all aftercare instructions on this page to make sure you can commit to this brow journey – 
  especially in the first 10 days. How you take care of your fresh brows is OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE!</p>

<strong><h4>Follow these simple rules:</h4></strong>

<p>
The best results come from the do nothing or dry healing method. Always remember to keep your brows extremely 
DRY for the next 10 days!
Keeping them dry makes them retain more detail, better colour, and more crisp strokes, so it’s worth it. It sounds 
tricky but it can be
 done if you put your mind to it!. Here's how...
</p>

<p>Within 2-3 hours after the procedure wash the ointment off your brows with sterile water and the gauze pad included
   in your kit. Keep your face directly out of the shower steam and do your best to wash your hair carefully and keep
    your face as dry as possible. Keep clean, dry paper towels on hand to pat dry if your brows accidentally get moist.
     Keep showers brief as too much steam can harm brows. When washing be sure not to splash water onto your face. Instead use a 
     washcloth or disposable cleansing wipe to wash AROUND the brows, making sure they stay dry. 
     Use product-free blotting paper 3 times a day for normal skin, and 6 times a day for oily skin directly on top of the 
     brows – and then the surrounding area for the first 10 days as well. Do not apply any cosmetics on your brows for 
     AT LEAST 10 days. If your skin starts to feel tight and dry around day 7 post treatment, you can use a small amount
      of coconut oil or a fragrance-free moisturiser such as cetaphil. IF NEEDED gently moisturise the area once a day but
       only sparingly. NB: no heavy exercising or sweating for at least 10 days post procedure.
        If you want the best colour and detail retention, this is crucial. After 10 days please begin to wash your face
         normally, including your brows, with a gentle face wash such as cetaphil.
</p>

 <strong><h4>What to expect:</h4></strong>

<p>Immediately following your procedure, the tattooed area will appear to be darker and bolder in colour, more sharply
  defined or even have a more ‘filled-in’ appearance. This can last up to a week after the treatment while the initial 
  healing
  process takes place. The treated area may feel a bit like sunburn afterwards but there should be minimal discomfort and
   minimal
  redness. During the healing period there may be scabbing, flaking or peeling of the skin. If that happens, do not pick at
  it! Allow the scab or dry skin to come off on its own. This is very important! If scabs come off prematurely, the pigment will come
  out with it! It is absolutely normal for the skin to flake and peel. This is NOT your tattoo coming off – it’s just a light scab.
  The complete healing process takes about 4-6 weeks, at which time the true colour of the tattoo is evident. During this process
  your tattoo will soften and lighten. Be patient, even if you think too much colour has been lost, as your skin is
  still regenerating and naturally exfoliating.</p>


<strong><h4>Micro bladed brows go through many phases while healing! Check it out so you know what to expect....</h4></strong>



   <li>Day 1 – finely detailed, slight redness</li>
   <li>Day 2-4 – they become a few shades darker and more crisp and ‘filled-in’ looking as they form a light scab. This is only temporary. Don't panic!</li>
   <li>Day 5-12 – the scab naturally exfoliates, peels and flakes away over the course of several days.
       The fresh skin underneath is white and has waxy coating, making it appear that the brows are too light.
       Be patient!</li>
   <li>Day 10-30 – wash your brows with a mild cleanser. This will help the healing and
     shedding process at this point. The colour may appear light but will slowly come back to life as the new, white skin
     you settles in and heals. Wait at least 4 weeks to see the true colour as it will take on new strength. It’s only after
     4 weeks that your touch up/ adjustment can be done. Your second appointment is to tighten up your shape, touch up any light spots
     and also to assess how your skin reacts with the process, and the chosen colour. We note everyone’s pigment blend in case we need to layer in a different shade or 
     adjust the tone.
    Each procedure is customised just for you! This is a two-step process. Brows look really finished after the 2nd appointment!</li>


<strong><h4>Once healed:</h4></strong>
<p>Exposure to the sun over time can cause fading and discolouration of the pigment. Once completely healed, we recommend applying
  sunscreen daily on the treated area. Wear large sunglasses and a hat for further protection. Rinse and dry the area thoroughly when
   in contact with chlorine. Glycolic acid, microdermabrasion, chemical face peel products and laser treatment must be kept away from
   the tattooed area as continued use could lighten or discolour the pigment. If you are having laser resurfacing or laser hair removal
    after your tattoo has healed, please inform the laser technician. Continue at your own discretion. Laser procedures may darken,
    lighten or discolour the tattooed area. Once the treated area is completely healed, any changes or additions that need to be made
    can be done at your follow up appointment – no sooner than 4-8 weeks for the brow area's skin cells to completely regenerate and
    settle in. There are no implied or written guarantees if you do not take care of your tattoo, and everyone will heal a little
    differently.</p>


  <h4><strong>This procedure is not right for you IF</strong></h4>

        <li>you are using ACCUTANE or have used it within the past year.</li>
        <li>you have very oily skin and/or very large pores on your forehead. The hair strokestroke pigment may be rejected or it may
           heal very powdery/ fuzzy with loss of detail. It may need frequent touch ups. Often powder shading, or a combination brow,
            is a good replacement</li>
       <li>you want very thin brows. There should be at least a slight thickness in order to achieve desired hair-like detail.</li>
        <li>you are very tanned or sun damaged.</li>
        <li>your skin is very delicate, fragile, sensitive or problematic. Skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, heavy melasma etc. 
          that are present on the face will affect retention and longevity of microbladed brows.</li>
        <li>you are pregnant or nursing</li>
        <li>allergic to lidocaine</li>
        <li>highly prone to scarring or keloids</li>
        <li>epileptic</li>

      <strong><p>
          we strongly advise prospective new clients to book their first microblading
          appointment 1 to 2 months in advance of vacations, weddings and special occasions. This allows adequate
          time for healing of both your initial microblading appointment as well as a touch up appointment 3 to 6 weeks afterwards
