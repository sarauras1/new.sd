<p style="margin-top: 30px;"> Microblading is atattooing technique in which a small handheld tool made of several tiny needles is used to add 
  semi-permanent pigment the skin. Microblading differs from standard eyebrow tattooing because each hair stroke is 
  created by hand using a blade which creates fine slices in the skin, whereas eyebrow tattoos are done with a machine
   and single needle. Microblading is typically used on eyebrows to create, enhance or reshape their appearance in terms
    of both shape and colour. It deposits pigment into the upper region of the dermis, so it fades more rapidly than 
    traditional tattooing techniques, which deposit pigment deeper. Microblading artists are not necessarily tattoo
     artists, and vice versa, because the techniques require different training.
  </p>



<h3>Durability</h3>
<p>The microblading procedure is a semi-permanent tattoo,
  Like all tattoos, microblading can fade, depending on multiple factors, including quality of 
  pigment/ink used, UV exposure, elements found in skincare products, medications. The treatment 
  lasts from one to two years. A touch-up session is encouraged 6 months after the first microblading 
  procedure.</p>


<h3>Microblading aftercare</h3>



<p> Please read all aftercare instructions on this page to make sure you can commit to this brow journey,
  especially the first 10 days. How you take care of your fresh brows is EVERYTHING!  </p>






<strong><h4>these simple rules for the best results:</h4></strong>



<p>The best results come from the “do nothing” or “dry healing” method. The absolute best results 
  come from keeping your brows extremely DRY for the next 10 days! Keeping them dry makes them retain more
   detail, better colour, and more crisp strokes, so its worth it. It sounds tricky- but can be done if your'e 
   mindful of it. Here's how...
  </p>

<p>Within 2-3 hours after the procedure wash the ointment off your brows with sterile water and gauze pad included in your kit.
  Keep your face directly out of the shower steam and do your best to carefully wash hair and keep face as dry as possible. Keep clean, dry paper towels on hand to pat dry if they accidentally get moist. Also keep showers brief,as too much steam can harm brows as well.
  When washing your face, be sure not to splash water onto your face like we normally do. Instead use a washcloth or disposable cleansing wipe to wash AROUND the brows, making sure they stay dry
  Use product free blotting paper 3 times a day for normal skin, and 6 times a day for oily skin directly on top of the brows and then the surrounding area for the first 10 days as well.
  Do not apply any cosmetics on your brows for AT LEAST 10 days. If your skin starts to feel tight and dry around day 7 post treatment, you can use a small amount of * coconut oil* ( or a fragrance -free moisturiser, such as cetaphil) IF NEEDED to gently moisturise the area once a day. If you do need to moisturise, please do sparingly. 
  No heavy exercising or sweating for at least 10 days post procedure. If you want the best colour and detail retention, this is crucial.
  After 10 days please begin to wash your face normally, including your brows! With a gentle face wash, such as cetaphil.
  </p>


  

 <strong><h4>What to expect:</h4></strong>



<p>Immediately following your procedure, the tattooed area will appear to be darker and bolder in colour,
   more sharply defined or even have a more filled in appearance. This can last up to a week after the treatment
    while the initial healing process takes place. The treated area may feel a bit like sunburn afterwards but there 
    should be minimal discomfort and minimal redness.
During the healing period,there may be scabbing, flaking or peeling of the skin. If hat happens, do not pick at it! 
Allow the scab or dry skin to come off on its own. This is very important! If scabs come off prematurely, the pigment 
will come out with it! It is totally normal for the skin to flake and peel, this is not your tattoo coming off its just
 a light scab.
The complete healing process takes about 4-6 weeks, at which time the true colour of the tattoo is evident. During this
 process, your tattoo will soften and lighten. Be patient, even if you think too much colour has been lost, as your skin 
 is still regenerating and naturally exfoliating.</p>
 

<strong><h4>Micro bladed brows go through many phases while healing! Check it out so you know what to expect....</h4></strong>



   <li>y 1 – finely detailed, slight redness</li>
   <li>Day 2-4 -  They become a few shades darker and more crisp and filled in looking as they form a light scab. 
       This is only temporary – Don't panic!</li>
   <li>Day 5-12 – The scab naturally exfoliates, peels and flakes away over the course of several days.
       The fresh skin underneath is white and has waxy coating, making it appear that the brows are too light. 
       Be patient!</li>
   <li>Day 10-30 – On day 10 – wash your brows with a mild cleanser! This will help the healing and shedding process at this point. The colour may appear light, but will slowly come back to life and bloom back to the surface as that new, white skin you have settles in and heals. Wait at least 4 weeks to see the true colour, as it will take on new strength, and it is only after 4 weeks that your touch up/ adjustment can be done. Your second appointment is to tighten up your shape, touch up any light spots and also to asses how your skin reacts with the process, and the chosen colour. We note everyones pigment blend, in case we need to layer in a different shade or adjust the tone. Each procedure is customised just for your! 
       This is a two step process. Brows look really finished after the 2nd appointment!</li>


<strong><h4>Once healed:</h4></strong>



 exposure to the sun over time can cause fading and discolouration of the pigment. Once completely healed,e recommend
 applying sunscreen daily on the treated area. Wear large sunglasses and a hat for further protection. Rinse and dry 
 the area thoroughly when in contact with chlorine.
 Glycolic acid, microdermabrasion, chemical face peel products and laser treatment must be kept away from the
 tattooed area as continued use could lighten or discolour the pigment.
 If you are having laser resurfacing or laser hair removal after your tattoo has healed, please inform the laser technician. Continue at your own discretion. Laser procedures may darker,
 lighten or discolour the tattooed area.
Once the treated area is completely healed, any changes or additions that need to be made can be done at your follow up appointment 
no sooner than 4-8 weeks for the brow area's skin cells to completely regenerate and settle in.
There are no implied or written guarantees if you do not take care of your tattoo, and everyone will heal a 
little differently.

<h4><strong>This procedure is not right for you if...</strong></h4>

        <li>You are using ACCUTANE or have used it within the past year.</li> 
        <li>If you have very oily skin and/or very large pores on your forehead the hair stroke
          pigment may be rejected or it may heal very powdery/ fuzzy with loss of detail. It may need frequent touch ups. 
          Often powder shading, or a combination brow is a good replacement!</li> 
       <li>If you want very thin brows ( there needs to be at least a slight thickness in order to achieve desired 
      hairlike detail)</li> 
        <li>if you are very tan or sun damaged.</li> 
        <li>your skin is very delicate, fragile, sensitive or problematic. Skin conditions like Eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, heavy melasma etc.
             that are present on the face will affect retention and longevity of micro bladed brows.</li>
        <li>If are pregnant or nursing</li>
        <li>If are allergic to lidocaine</li> 
        <li>If are highly prone to scarring or keloids</li> 
        <li>If are epileptic</li>

          appointment 1 to 2 months in advance of vacations, weddings and special occasions. This allows adequate 
          time for healing of both your initial micrblading appointment as well as a touch up appointment 3 to 6 weeks after
