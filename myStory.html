    <h3 class="h3-mystory">My story</h3>
    <p>I was born in the Middle East and married at 20. I was naïve and not sure of my journey in life. On my husband’s advice I enrolled at a college of hair and beauty, graduating in 1998 and opening my own salon before moving to Europe in 1999. Looking back I realise that not being able to speak English properly held me back in my career in the UK and yet I also know deep down that I wasn’t ready at that time to embrace the gifts I was born with.</p>
    <p>I’ve always had a passion for eyebrows. The minute I look at someone’s brows I can see the finished brow. I analyse each hair. Some of my clients call me a brow GP; others a brow guru. I can only say that I communicate with brows. I speak their language!</p>
    <p>In 2016 I was born again spiritually and as a result I began to see a massive change in my career. I started to have a deep connection with my clients. I wanted them to see that as well as being beautiful inside, that with the right shape for their brows they could be beautiful outside.</p>
   <p>I think this story illustrates perfectly what I mean. One of my clients told me at her first appointment that she had been bullied because her face always looked so sad. She said to me: “I am not sad, Silvia, so why does everyone think that I am?” I told her it was because of the shape of her brows. She didn’t believe me at first but after I’d reshaped her brows she looked in the mirror and had tears in her eyes. She could see the transformation. She looked beautiful and happy! It was a life-changing moment. She was never told she looked sad again.</p>
   <p>Among my clients are celebrities and members of the Royal Family but everyone is a VIP as far as I’m concerned. I have been blessed to look after some amazing people, some of whom have left a deep footprint on my life.</p>
